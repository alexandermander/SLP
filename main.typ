= Authentication + Link Layer Security
== Network Security Assignment part 1

#assignment[ 
  #colbreak()
*Objective:*
  Research and write a concise paragraph about techniques used to mitigate ARP spoofing and Spanning
Tree Protocol (STP) attacks (Layer 2 attacks). Please write details on how the chosen technique detects
and prevents the attack, and any potential limitations they may have in a network environment. Please
also mention your opinion about the complexity of the techniques you found.

    *Static ARP entries:* Using static entries in the ARP
		table means the IP–MAC mapping cannot be altered by ARP
		spoofing. The limitation is that when a new device joins the
		network, its IP–MAC pair must be manually added to the ARP
		tables of the relevant devices. its nice that i can setup this
		in a static mac adreses but let say that i ahve to do this for
			a capnut and maitnign this so alle vesties are update date
			and 
		],
  enum.item()[
			*Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI):*Is a technique where the
			switches are configured to map each device in the network
			to a specific IP–MAC pair. If an ARP spoofing attack
			occurs, then the switch detects that there is an
			unauthorized ARP request. The limitation of this method is
			that the switch must be set up with DAI and must be a
			supported type of switch. This is a better solution than
			the static assigning since there is a dynamic system in
			the switches that can help manage the ARP spoofing attacks
			instead of manually setting each device. 
		],
	enum.item()[

		*XArp:* Is an anti-spoofing software that can detect if an ARP
			spoofing attack is being performed on a target system that
			has installed the XArp on the system, and this is the
			limitation—that I have to install the XArp and make sure
			that it’s up to date and has no vulnerabilities in this
			program.

== Network Security Assignment part 2
#assignment[ 
  #colbreak()
*Objective:*
  In this assignment we are going to emulate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using this network
topology.

As an attacker we should connect to the switch to be able to communicate with the target/victim
hosts. From now on, we refer to our two targets hosts as victims.

#answer(title: "Experiencing Layer 2 attacks", width: auto)[
	#enum(
		enum.item[

			The setup I have is two lightweight Lubuntu systems and a
			Kali Linux where the Man-in-the-Middle attack will be
			performed. The network is connected to a NAT network
			through my local machine. 


			#figure(
			  image("Screenshot 2025-09-19 143715.png", width: 120%),
			  caption: [
				The two Lubuntu machines
			  ],
			
			) <fig:lubuntu>

			In @fig:lubuntu there are the two lightweight
			Lubuntu machines. The right machine is performing a ping
			to the other machine (on the left), and the left machine
			is running the arp -a command to show the devices that are
			running on this NAT network.

		],

		enum.item[

			The next step is to perform the ARP spoofing attack on the
			two targets. To do that, on the Kali machine I use the
			program Ettercap to scan for the two targets and select
			them as victims, where it will then perform the spoofing
			attack.

			#figure(
			  image("Screenshot 2025-09-19 143910.png", width: 120%),
			  caption: [
				The two Lubuntu machines
			  ],
			
			) <fig:wire>

			In @fig:wire, it shows how the attack is under execution,
			where on the left is the Lubuntu machine that performs a
			ping to the other Lubuntu machine (on the right). But
			since we have created a Man-in-the-Middle between the two
			targets, the traffic can now be seen on the Kali machine,
			as shown in the image. In this, Wireshark is capturing the
			traffic between the two machines.
